A version of QuaZip is included here (custom_quazip.zip) which uses customised CMake
scripts that leverage the build scripts of [libbuild](https://github.com/richeytastic/libbuild)
so that QuaZip can be easily found when building FaceTools.

Download [libbuild](https://github.com/richeytastic/libbuild) for easy build and install of the FaceTools library.
